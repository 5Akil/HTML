        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> The Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup Language for document designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt; img &gt; and  &lt;input &gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt; p &gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
        
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Before creating any web page we should add an boilerplate template. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                 Currently, <b>HTML5</b>  is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
       </li>
       
       <li>
        <h3>What is Boilerplate?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Boilerplate is a starter code which contains important information like the docktype, metadata external stylesheet and script tags.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    As we can see above there are some tags like docktype, html, head, meta, title etc.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3> What is a docktype in HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>docktype tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in. if we forget to include this line of code, then some of the HTML 5 tags like,
                    &lt; article &gt;, &lt;  header &gt; and &lt;footer&gt; may not be supported by the browser.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>What is the HTML root element?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The &lt; html &gt; tag is the top level element of the HTML file. You will nest the &lt; head &gt; and &lt; body &gt; tags inside of it.
                    The lang attribute inside the opening  tag sets the language for the page. It is also good to include it for accessibility reasons, because screen readers will know how to properly pronounce the text.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>What are head tags in HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The &lt;  head &gt; tags contain information that is processed by machines. Inside the &lt; head &gt; tags, you will nest metadata which is data that describes the document to the machine.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>What is UTF-8 character encoding?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    UTF-8 is the most common character encoding method used on the internet today, and is the default character set for HTML5. This will usually be the first &lt;meta &gt; tag shown in the &lt; head &gt;  element.
                </p>
        
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>What is the viewport meta tag in HTML?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This tag renders the width of the page to the width of the device's screen size. If you have a mobile device that is 600px wide, then the browser window will also be 600px wide.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
               <p>
                 This &lt; meta &gt; tag specifies the document mode for Internet Explorer. IE=edge is the highest supported mode. 
               </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The &lt; title &gt; tag is the title for the web page. This text is shown in the browser's title bar.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                   The &lt; body &gt; tag in HTML is used to define the main content present inside an HTML page. 
                </p>
